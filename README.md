"# sports-article-objectivity" 
This project was done to identify which gramatical components of a sports article could help predict if an article was to be objective and subjective. Based on frequency values of these gramatical components, multiple machine learning methods were used to build prediction models. Variables such as existential there, quotations, adverbs, and other components were determined to be significant in the prediction process. The logistic regression (base R) and random forest (random forest package) models were determined to preform the best with this data. Contained is my code done using R, multiple visualizations using ggplot, a powerpoint of my project, and an excel sheet of the different model accuracy results.
